# Micro RISC V
I am working hard to implement a RV32I Subset CPU in Verilog HDL.

**Mercy, please!** 

I am a sophermore student, majoring in software engineering, which means there wasn't and may not to be any systematic traing or relevant experience in digital circuit design. I started this project from scratch, out of interest.

If I make dumb mistakes, let me know via [Email](github@akenonet.com), or just forgive me.
